# Roar Forever — Changelog

Release notes for the standalone player voice-emote sound addon.

## 0.6.0-beta — 2026-10-22

- Added addon-to-addon communication for `/roar`, `/train`, `/forthehorde`, and `/forthealliance` so two Roar Forever users can share restored emotes without relying on visible chat alone.
- Emote packets include the sender’s outdoor position when available. Receivers apply distance-aware restored emote audio: same-world distance ≥50 yards is silent (even before SoundKit mappings exist); within range an empty SoundKit table still falls back to FileDataID; missing position uses normal full-volume fallback; a different instance ID stays silent.
- Text-emote detection remains for players without the addon. A short 0.10s fallback waits for a matching COMM packet so the two paths do not double-play either order.
- Group `/train` still leaves native party/raid train audio to the game (no COMM double). Faction cries may use COMM in groups because Forever has no native playback.
- Debug helpers: `/rf debugcomm`, `/rf debugpos`, `/rf soundkit <ID> [volume]`, `/rf voltest <ID>` (candidate SoundKit testers, not a mapping discovery tool). Verified SoundKitIDs can be dropped into `voiceSoundKits` later for true attenuation.
- Per-speaker voice restart: the same player spamming or switching restored emotes stops only their own previous line and starts the new one. Different players’ restored voices play in parallel. Options preview still stops the previous preview sample when you click another.

## 0.5.7-beta — 2026-10-12

- Clarified the options note: Roar Forever restores built-in World of Warcraft voice-emote sounds; it does not add or bundle audio.
- Restored voices no longer overlap: starting a new restored voice stops the previous one.
- Lowered the restored-emote duplicate cooldown from 0.30s to 0.07s so rapid repeats can restart sooner.

## 0.5.6-beta — 2026-10-12

- Fixed "Interface action failed because of an AddOn" on `/train` and faction cries. Restored the working `C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage` path and send the custom `/e` line immediately on the slash/keybind call stack instead of after `C_Timer.After`, which Forever treats as an automated chat action.
- Kept the 0.5.5 faction-cry fix: `/forthehorde` and `/forthealliance` still announce from the slash command even when `DoEmote` is a no-op.

## 0.5.5-beta — 2026-10-12

- Fixed faction-cry chat announcements so `/forthehorde` and `/forthealliance` send their distinctive `/e` line from the slash command even when `DoEmote` does nothing. A follow-up 0.5.6 fix restored the safe chat API path after `/train` broke.

## 0.5.4-beta — 2026-10-12

- Restores the missing `/forthehorde` and `/forthealliance` faction cries using the original race/sex-specific voice assets contained in the World of Warcraft Forever client.
- Added `/forthealliance` (alias `/fta`) for Alliance characters, with the same announcement, multiplayer, group/raid, options, and `/rf test` support as `/forthehorde` / `/fth`.
- Verified Alliance voices for Human, Dwarf, Gnome, and Night Elf (male and female). No Skyborne faction-cry line was found for either faction.
- Shared faction-emote handling for both cries. Forever still has no native emote tokens, so the cheer animation may be missing until Blizzard wires them; the addon keeps calling `DoEmote("FORTHEHORDE")` and `DoEmote("FORTHEALLIANCE")` for forward compatibility.

## 0.5.3-beta — 2026-10-12

- Added `/forthehorde` (alias `/fth`) for Horde characters. Forever still has the race/sex “For the Horde!” voice files, but does not wire the emote, so Roar Forever plays them and sends a distinctive chat line other Roar Forever users can hear.
- Verified Orc, Tauren, Troll, and Undead male/female FileDataIDs in the Forever client. No Skyborne for-horde line was found yet.
- Forever’s EmotesText has no `FORTHEHORDE` token yet, so the native cheer animation may not play until Blizzard wires it. The addon keeps calling `DoEmote("FORTHEHORDE")` so a future client build can pick it up automatically.

## 0.5.2-beta — 2026-10-11

- Skyborne already have a client `/roar`. Roar Forever no longer double-plays roar for yourself or for Skyborne group members. Other races still get the addon roar there. Nearby non-grouped Skyborne roars are still restored.

## 0.5.1-beta — 2026-10-07

- Stopped group-member `/train` from playing twice. Like the other non-roar voices, train is left to the game in a party or raid.

## 0.5.0-beta — 2026-10-07

- Added a movable Warcraft-style options window, opened with `/rf` or `/rf config`.
- Added individual switches for all 20 supported emote categories. Aliases share one switch.
- Added speaker buttons that preview a random mapped sound across all races and genders, including the full joke and flirt pools. Previews work with automatic playback disabled and never send chat messages.
- Added a separate switch for the `/train` chat announcement. Turning it off leaves the native train emote available.
- Bundled English, German, French, Spanish, and Russian emote detection and menu labels; English GB and Spanish MX use their corresponding language packs.
- Replaced broad keyword detection with full client-message templates from Forever build 1.60.1.70009. Custom emote chat is accepted only for the exact train announcement.
- Fixed player identity checks so a different GUID cannot be mistaken for the local player or a group member just because names match.
- Kept the existing congratulations `ding` exclusion unchanged.
- Settings use the existing account-wide `RoarForeverDB`; prior on/off settings are preserved and new switches default to on.

Validation: Lua 5.1 checks cover 593 localized template cases and options, previews, train announcements, saved-option loading, and identity regressions. Actual translated-client behavior and UI appearance still require in-game validation.

## 0.4.7 — 2026-09-30

- Fixed a Lua error that could fire when a party or raid member used a voiced emote such as `/oom`.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-09-26

- `/train` now sends "blows a train whistle. Choo choo!" so other people using Roar Forever can hear it, including in a party or raid.
- Restored the `/whistle` sound for nearby players.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-09-26

- Restored nearby-player voices for `/cry`, `/congrats` / `/congratulate`, and `/followme`.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-09-26

- Restored nearby-player voices for `/oom`, `/sigh`, and `/charge`.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-09-26

- Restored nearby-player voices for `/healme`, `/rasp`, and `/flirt`.
- In a party or raid, only `/roar` is restored. The other voices are left to the game.
- `/rf off` turns Roar Forever off. `/rf on` turns it back on.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-09-25

- Restored nearby-player voices for `/flee` and `/retreat`. Both use the flee voice.
- Restored nearby-player voices for `/welcome`.
- Restored nearby-player voices for `/yes` and `/no`.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-09-25

- Added Skyborne voices for roar, cheer, laugh, and joke.
- `/joke` and `/silly` now pick a random line from that character's full set of joke lines.
- `/moo` stays Tauren-only.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-25

- Expanded Roar Forever beyond `/roar` to other missing player voice emotes.
- Added nearby-player voices for `/cheer`, `/laugh` / `/lol`, `/joke` / `/silly`, and Tauren `/moo`.
- Your own normal voiced emotes are left to the client. `/roar` still plays for you as well.
- `/rf test` can try roar, cheer, laugh, joke, and moo. `/rf status` lists the voices mapped for your character.
- `/train` is not restored. Forever does not announce another player's train emote.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-20

- Published Roar Forever as a standalone sound-only addon.
- Retained racial voice playback for detected `/roar` emotes and the short duplicate-playback cooldown.
- Included sound testing and status commands: `/rf test`, `/rf status`, and `/rf id <FileDataID>`.
- Reduced the install package to two runtime files: `RoarForever.toc` and `RoarForever.lua`.
- Removed ability-triggered emotes, their configuration window, saved profiles, and recovery setup from the public addon.
- Requires no saved settings, directory links, or account-specific configuration.

Earlier combined-addon development is outside the scope of this standalone changelog and remains available in repository history.

## Documentation-only audit #33 — 2026-10-27

- Added separate interaction-design, audio/content provenance and AI-collaboration documents; expanded project concept, architecture, decisions, roadmap and historical journal.
- Distinguished 0.6.0-beta distance-based silence and fallback sound playback from future SoundKitID volume attenuation.
- Preserved addon Lua, TOC, tests and audio references; no live-client test or sound mapping verification performed.
